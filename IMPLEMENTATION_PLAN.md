## Implementation Plan — README Alignment

### 1. Deliver Evidence-Backed Command Execution — Status: Complete
- Requires-evidence commands now run tests automatically and fail fast when they do not pass (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:346`).
- Successful executions demand real repository diffs; otherwise the executor records missing evidence and errors out (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:389`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:509`).
- Regression coverage locks this behavior through plan-only assertions and telemetry checks (`tests/test_commands.py:399`, `tests/test_commands.py:990`).

### 2. Honor `/sc:test` Flags — Status: Complete
- `_run_requested_tests` propagates coverage, marker, e2e, and target hints directly into the pytest invocation (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2037`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2054`).
- Structured metrics (pass rate, counts, coverage) flow back into command results and artifacts for evidence review (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2155`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:334`).
- Tests exercise flag translation and failure reporting, including `/sc:test --coverage` expectations (`tests/test_commands.py:288`, `tests/test_commands.py:338`).

### 3. Implement a Real Quality Loop — Status: Complete
- The remediation improver re-invokes agents, applies change plans, and reruns tests during each loop iteration (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1187`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1225`).
- Loop orchestration persists assessments and iteration history for downstream guardrails (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1765`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1786`).
- Regression tests cover both successful remediation and propagated failures (`tests/test_commands.py:418`, `tests/test_commands.py:472`).

### 4. Wire Multi-Model Consensus to Real Providers — Status: Complete
- `ModelRouterFacade` now hydrates live provider adapters and gracefully falls back to deterministic heuristics when keys are absent (`SuperClaude/ModelRouter/facade.py:103`).
- Provider clients perform authenticated HTTP requests via the shared async helper and surface structured responses for consensus decisions (`SuperClaude/APIClients/http_utils.py:1`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/openai_client.py:122`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/anthropic_client.py:105`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/google_client.py:111`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/xai_client.py:113`).

### 5. Flesh Out Operational Command Handlers — Status: Complete
- `/sc:build`, `/sc:git`, and `/sc:workflow` execute real pipelines, capture evidence, and emit artifacts for downstream guardrails (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:865`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:990`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1135`).
- Comprehensive helper utilities provide deterministic subprocess execution, artifact management, and workflow synthesis so results align with README expectations (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2092`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2197`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1696`).

### 5. Flesh Out Operational Command Handlers — Status: Outstanding
- `_execute_build`, `_execute_git`, and `_execute_workflow` continue to return placeholders instead of invoking automation (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:863`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:875`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:883`).
- The README promises smoke-level automation, so real handlers plus focused tests are still required.
