## Implementation Plan — README Alignment

### 1. Deliver Evidence-Backed Command Execution — Status: Complete
- Requires-evidence commands now auto-run pytest and attach artifacts whenever the metadata demands
  evidence (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:330`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:335`).
- Successful runs require concrete repository diffs; otherwise the executor flags missing evidence
  and fails the command (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:391`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:508`).
- Regression coverage verifies both plan-only handling and telemetry emission
  (`tests/test_commands.py:978`, `tests/test_commands.py:1002`).

### 2. Honor `/sc:test` Flags — Status: Complete
- `_run_requested_tests` propagates coverage, marker, e2e, and target hints directly into the pytest
  invocation (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2741`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2765`).
- Structured metrics flow back into command results to support evidence review
  (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2865`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2874`).
- Tests exercise flag translation and failure reporting, including `/sc:test --coverage`
  expectations (`tests/test_commands.py:407`, `tests/test_commands.py:452`).

### 3. Implement a Real Quality Loop — Status: Complete
- The remediation improver re-invokes agents, applies change plans, and reruns tests during each loop
  iteration (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2476`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2487`).
- Loop orchestration persists assessments and iteration history for downstream guardrails
  (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2509`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2554`).
- Regression tests cover both successful remediation and propagated failures
  (`tests/test_commands.py:537`, `tests/test_commands.py:603`).

### 4. Wire Multi-Model Consensus to Real Providers — Status: Complete
- `ModelRouterFacade` hydrates live provider adapters and falls back to deterministic heuristics when
  API keys are absent (`SuperClaude/ModelRouter/facade.py:28`, `SuperClaude/ModelRouter/facade.py:103`).
- Provider clients perform authenticated HTTP requests via the shared async helper and surface
  structured responses for consensus decisions (`SuperClaude/APIClients/http_utils.py:1`,
  `SuperClaude/APIClients/openai_client.py:122`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/anthropic_client.py:105`,
  `SuperClaude/APIClients/google_client.py:111`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/xai_client.py:113`).

### 5. Flesh Out Operational Command Handlers — Status: Complete
- `/sc:build`, `/sc:git`, and `/sc:workflow` execute actionable pipelines, capture evidence, and emit
  artifacts (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:865`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:990`,
  `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1135`).
- Helper utilities provide deterministic subprocess execution, artifact management, and workflow
  synthesis so results align with README expectations (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2197`,
  `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2224`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1696`).
- Regression coverage exercises each handler and guards the evidence requirements
  (`tests/test_commands.py:290`, `tests/test_commands.py:328`, `tests/test_commands.py:373`).

### Outstanding Work
- None.
