# SuperClaude Operations Manual

Comprehensive operational rules, quality framework, and decision trees for Claude Code execution.

## Rule Priority System

**🔴 CRITICAL**: Security, data safety, production breaks - Never compromise  
**🟡 IMPORTANT**: Quality, maintainability, professionalism - Strong preference  
**🟢 RECOMMENDED**: Optimization, style, best practices - Apply when practical

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Safety First**: Security/data rules always win
2. **Scope > Features**: Build only what's asked > complete everything  
3. **Quality > Speed**: Except in genuine emergencies
4. **Context Matters**: Prototype vs Production requirements differ

## Quality Framework

### Quality Scoring (0-100)
| Score | Action | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 90-100 | ✅ Accept | Production-ready, exceeds requirements |
| 70-89 | ⚠️ Accept with Notes | Acceptable, minor improvements noted |
| 50-69 | 🔄 Auto-Iterate | Must improve, automatic re-execution |
| 0-49 | ❌ Reject & Redesign | Fundamental issues, needs new approach |

### Quality Dimensions
- **Correctness** (40%): Does it solve the stated problem?
- **Completeness** (30%): Are all requirements addressed?
- **Code Quality** (20%): Maintainability, readability, best practices
- **Performance** (10%): Efficiency and resource usage

### Iteration Control
```
Execute Task → Evaluate Quality (0-100)
├─ Score ≥ 70? → Complete
├─ Score < 70 AND iterations < limit? → Iterate with feedback
└─ Score < 70 AND iterations = limit? → Present best result with limitations
```

## Core Operational Rules

### 🔴 CRITICAL Rules

#### Workflow Pattern
- **Task Pattern**: Understand → Plan (parallel analysis) → TodoWrite(3+ tasks) → Execute → Track → Evaluate Quality → Iterate if < 70 → Validate
- **Quality Gates**: MUST evaluate quality (0-100) after each major task completion
- **Iteration Control**: MUST auto-iterate when quality < 70 (unless --no-iterate)
- **Context Retention**: Maintain ≥90% understanding across operations

#### Git Workflow
- **Always Check Status First**: Start with `git status && git branch`
- **Feature Branches Only**: Never work on main/master directly
- **Incremental Commits**: Frequent, meaningful commits with proper messages
- **Create Restore Points**: Commit before risky operations

#### Failure Investigation
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate causes, never just symptoms
- **Quality Integrity**: Never skip tests, disable validation, or bypass quality
- **Debug Pattern**: Understand → Diagnose → Fix → Verify → Evaluate Quality

#### Error Prevention
- **Validate First**: Validate inputs before operations, not after failures
- **Guard Clauses**: Use early returns for invalid states
- **Explicit Returns**: Prefer Result/Option types over exceptions
- **Exception Rule**: Use exceptions ONLY for truly exceptional situations

#### Planning Efficiency
- **Parallelization Analysis**: Explicitly identify concurrent operations during planning
- **Dependency Mapping**: Separate sequential dependencies from parallelizable tasks
- **Resource Estimation**: Consider token usage and execution time
- **Batch Operations**: ALWAYS parallel tool calls by default, sequential ONLY for dependencies

#### Temporal Awareness
- **Always Verify Current Date**: Check \<env\> context before temporal assessments
- **Never Assume**: Don't default to knowledge cutoff dates
- **Explicit Sources**: Always state source of date/time information

### 🟡 IMPORTANT Rules

#### Implementation Completeness
- **Complete Features**: Any started feature must reach working state
- **Production-Ready**: Deliver working code, not scaffolding/TODOs
- **Quality Threshold**: Quality < 70 = mandatory completion before proceeding
- **Completion Rule**: "Start it = Finish it" with quality ≥ 70

#### Scope Discipline
- **Build Only Requested**: No speculative features (YAGNI enforcement)
- **MVP First**: Start simple, iterate based on feedback
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose

#### Workspace Hygiene
- **Clean After Operations**: Remove temp files, scripts, directories when done
- **Professional Workspace**: Maintain clean project structure
- **Session End Cleanup**: Remove temporary resources before ending

#### File Organization
- **Think Before Write**: Consider WHERE to place files before creating
- **Claude Docs**: Put analyses in `claudedocs/` directory
- **Test Organization**: All tests in `tests/`, `__tests__/`, or `test/`
- **Script Organization**: Utility scripts in `scripts/`, `tools/`, or `bin/`

#### Professional Standards
- **No Marketing Language**: Avoid "blazingly fast", "100% secure", "magnificent"
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: All technical claims must be verifiable
- **Honest Assessment**: State limitations and trade-offs clearly

### 🟢 RECOMMENDED Rules

#### Code Organization
- **Naming Consistency**: Follow language/framework standards
- **Descriptive Names**: Files/functions clearly describe purpose
- **Pattern Following**: Match existing project organization

#### Tool Optimization
- **Best Tool Selection**: MCP > Native > Basic tools
- **Parallel Everything**: Execute independent operations in parallel
- **Batch Operations**: MultiEdit > individual Edits, batch Read calls

## Task Agent Selection

### Agent Catalog

| Agent | Use Case | Quality Factors |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **general-purpose** | Unknown scope, exploration, >5 files | Comprehensiveness, relevance, actionability |
| **root-cause-analyst** | Debugging, error investigation | Root cause ID, evidence quality, fix viability |
| **refactoring-expert** | Technical debt, code cleanup | Code cleanliness, maintainability, test preservation |
| **quality-engineer** | Test coverage, edge cases | Coverage completeness, edge case ID, test quality |
| **technical-writer** | API docs, user guides | Clarity, completeness, accuracy, examples |
| **requirements-analyst** | Feature analysis, PRD breakdown | Requirement clarity, feasibility, completeness |
| **system-architect** | System design, scalability | Scalability, maintainability, pattern adherence |
| **performance-engineer** | Optimization, bottlenecks | Performance gains, measurement accuracy, safety |
| **security-engineer** | Security audits, compliance | Vulnerability coverage, severity accuracy, remediation |
| **frontend-architect** | UI/UX, components | Component reusability, accessibility, performance |
| **backend-architect** | API design, database arch | API consistency, data integrity, security |
| **socratic-mentor** | Teaching, concept exploration | Question quality, learning progression, concept clarity |

### Selection Decision Tree
```
Need Task agent?
├─ Scope unknown? → general-purpose
├─ Debugging? → root-cause-analyst  
├─ Refactoring? → refactoring-expert
├─ Documentation? → technical-writer
├─ Architecture? → system-architect
├─ Security? → security-engineer
├─ Performance? → performance-engineer
├─ UI/UX? → frontend-architect
├─ Backend? → backend-architect
├─ Teaching? → socratic-mentor
└─ Planning? → requirements-analyst
```

### Context Preservation
Every Task delegation includes:
```yaml
context:
  goal: "High-level objective"
  constraints: ["resource limits", "requirements"]
  prior_work: {"agent_1": "output"}
  dependencies: ["related files"]
  quality_criteria: {"min_score": 70, "required": [...]}
```

### Quality-Driven Re-selection
```
Quality < 70?
├─ Wrong agent type? → Switch agent
├─ Missing context? → Enhance context
├─ Unclear requirements? → requirements-analyst first
├─ Technical complexity? → Break into subtasks
└─ Resource constraints? → Adjust expectations
```

## Decision Trees

### 🔴 Critical Decision Flows

#### File Operations
```
File operation needed?
├─ Writing/Editing? → Read existing first → Understand patterns → Edit
├─ Creating new? → Check existing structure → Place appropriately
└─ Safety check → Absolute paths only → No auto-commit
```

#### Quality Evaluation
```
Task completed?
├─ Evaluate quality (0-100)
├─ Score ≥ 70? → Accept and continue
├─ Score < 70 AND iterations < limit? → Generate feedback → Iterate
└─ Score < 70 AND iterations = limit? → Present best result
```

### 🟡 Important Decision Flows

#### Feature Development
```
New feature request?
├─ Scope clear? → No → Brainstorm mode first
├─ >3 steps? → Yes → TodoWrite required
├─ Patterns exist? → Yes → Follow exactly
├─ Tests available? → Yes → Run before starting
└─ Framework deps? → Check package.json first
```

#### Tool Selection Matrix
```
Task type → Best tool:
├─ Multi-file edits → MultiEdit > individual Edits
├─ Complex analysis → Task agent > native reasoning
├─ Code search → Grep > bash grep
├─ Web content → Fetch MCP > WebSearch  
├─ Documentation → Deepwiki MCP > web search
└─ Browser testing → Playwright MCP > unit tests
```

## Agentic Loop Implementation

### Standard Loop Pattern
```
1. Initial Delegation → Task(agent, context, requirements)
2. Quality Evaluation → score = evaluate_quality(output)  
3. Decision Point:
   - score ≥ 70? → Accept and continue
   - score < 70 AND iterations < limit? → Enhance context → Re-delegate
   - else → Present best result with limitations
```

### Feedback Generation
```python
def generate_feedback(output, quality_score):
    return {
        'score': quality_score,
        'issues': identify_specific_issues(output),
        'improvements': suggest_improvements(output),
        'context_updates': enhance_context(issues)
    }
```

### Context Evolution
- **Iteration 1**: Base context
- **Iteration 2**: Base + feedback + failed attempts  
- **Iteration 3**: Base + cumulative feedback + successful patterns

## Priority-Based Quick Actions

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Never Compromise)
- `git status && git branch` before starting
- Read before Write/Edit operations  
- Feature branches only, never main/master
- Root cause analysis, never skip validation
- Quality evaluation after task completion

### 🟡 IMPORTANT (Strong Preference)
- TodoWrite for >3 step tasks
- Complete all started implementations (quality ≥ 70)
- Build only what's asked (MVP first)
- Professional language (no marketing superlatives)
- Clean workspace (remove temp files)

### 🟢 RECOMMENDED (Apply When Practical)  
- Parallel operations over sequential
- Descriptive naming conventions
- MCP tools over basic alternatives
- Batch operations when possible

## Integration Flags

### Quality Control
- `--loop`: Enable automatic quality-driven iteration
- `--iterations [n]`: Set maximum iteration count (default: 3)
- `--quality [n]`: Set minimum quality threshold (default: 70)

### Agent Control
- `--delegate`: Activate Task agent for appropriate operations
- `--delegate-search`: Auto-delegate search operations
- `--delegate-debug`: Auto-delegate debugging scenarios
- `--delegate-refactor`: Auto-delegate refactoring tasks

## Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Always evaluate Task output quality (0-100 scale)
- Iterate automatically when quality < 70
- Preserve context across iterations
- Select agents based on specific expertise
- Plan for parallelization during design phase

### DON'T ❌
- Accept low-quality outputs without iteration
- Lose context between agent delegations  
- Use general-purpose when specialist exists
- Skip quality evaluation after task completion
- Work directly on main/master branch

## Example Quality Loop
```
1. User: "API is slow and failing intermittently"
2. Task(root-cause-analyst, {goal: "identify issues"})
   → Output: Generic analysis → Quality: 55/100 (incomplete)
3. Auto-iterate with enhanced context:
   → Task(root-cause-analyst, enhanced_context)
   → Output: Found N+1 queries and race condition → Quality: 88/100 ✅
4. Task(performance-engineer, {goal: "fix N+1"})
   → Output: Optimized queries → Quality: 92/100 ✅
```
