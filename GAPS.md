# Gaps Between README Claims and Codebase

## Resolved

- `/sc:implement` now applies agent change plans, runs tests, and refuses success without repository
  evidence (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:330`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:391`,
  `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:508`; regression coverage at `tests/test_commands.py:978`).
- `/sc:test --coverage --e2e` forwards the requested flags to pytest, surfaces structured metrics,
  and records artifacts (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2741`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2865`,
  `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:336`; verified by `tests/test_commands.py:407` and
  `tests/test_commands.py:452`).
- The quality loop now runs a remediation pipeline instead of an identity pass-through, persisting
  iteration history and assessments (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2476`,
  `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:2509`; covered by `tests/test_commands.py:537` and
  `tests/test_commands.py:603`).
- Multi-model consensus routes to real providers when credentials are present and falls back
  deterministically when offline (`SuperClaude/ModelRouter/facade.py:28`,
  `SuperClaude/APIClients/http_utils.py:1`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/openai_client.py:122`,
  `SuperClaude/APIClients/anthropic_client.py:105`, `SuperClaude/APIClients/google_client.py:111`,
  `SuperClaude/APIClients/xai_client.py:113`; validated by `tests/test_model_router.py:394`).
- Operational commands `/sc:build`, `/sc:git`, and `/sc:workflow` execute tangible automation with
  artifact evidence and regression coverage (`SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:865`,
  `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:990`, `SuperClaude/Commands/executor.py:1135`; exercised in
  `tests/test_commands.py:290`, `tests/test_commands.py:328`, `tests/test_commands.py:373`).

## Outstanding

- None. README promises are now aligned with the implemented capabilities.
