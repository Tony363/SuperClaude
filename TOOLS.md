## Quality Evaluation
Simple scoring system for all outputs:

| Score | Action | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 90-100 | ‚úÖ Accept | Production-ready |
| 70-89 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Review | Acceptable with notes |
| < 70 | üîÑ Iterate | Auto-improve required |

Quality dimensions: Correctness (40%), Completeness (30%), Code Quality (20%), Performance (10%)

## Tool Selection Matrix

| Task | First Choice | Alternative |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Find unknown code | Task(general-purpose) | Grep/Glob |
| Debug error | Task(root-cause-analyst) | Sequential |
| Refactor code | Task(refactoring-expert) | Morphllm |
| Create UI | Magic | Manual coding |
| Get docs | Deepwiki | WebSearch |
| Rename symbol | Serena | Manual search |
| Bulk edits | Morphllm | MultiEdit |
| Complex analysis | Sequential | Native reasoning |
| Browser test | Playwright | Unit tests |
