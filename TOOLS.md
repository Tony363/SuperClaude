## Quality Evaluation
Simple scoring system for all outputs:

| Score | Action | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 90-100 | ‚úÖ Accept | Production-ready |
| 70-89 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Review | Acceptable with notes |
| < 70 | üîÑ Iterate | Auto-improve required |

Quality dimensions: Correctness (40%), Completeness (30%), Code Quality (20%), Performance (10%)
