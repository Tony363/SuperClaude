# SuperClaude Documentation Hub

> This directory mirrors the structure described in the README and points to the
> authoritative resources already shipped under `SuperClaude/Core`.

## Quick Starts and Essentials

- [User Guide](User-Guide/README.md) — Daily workflows and command usage.
- [API Reference](Reference/README.md) — Module-level integration notes.
- [Developer Guide](Developer-Guide/README.md) — Architecture and contribution tips.

For the most detailed, always up-to-date information, consult the curated core
documents:

- [QUICKSTART](../SuperClaude/Core/QUICKSTART.md)
- [CHEATSHEET](../SuperClaude/Core/CHEATSHEET.md)
- [OPERATIONS Manual](../SuperClaude/Core/OPERATIONS.md)

These stubs anchor the documentation links advertised in `README.md` and will
expand alongside the regenerated manuals.
