# Command Catalogue

The table below summarises the `/sc:*` commands available in the current build
and the artefacts they generate.

| Command              | Purpose                                            | Key Artefacts |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `/sc:implement`      | Plan and apply code changes with guardrails        | `SuperClaude/Implementation/`, metrics, optional diff |
| `/sc:test`           | Run project tests with flag translation            | Test logs, metrics, exit status |
| `/sc:workflow`       | Expand a PRD/spec into actionable steps            | Markdown plan under `SuperClaude/Implementation/` |
| `/sc:business-panel` | Generate stakeholder-facing status reports         | Markdown artefact + telemetry entry |
| `/sc:analyze`        | Perform static analysis and risk assessment        | Risk summary, metrics |
| `/sc:improve`        | Refine existing modules (e.g., readability passes) | Updated files + plan summary |
| `/sc:document`       | Generate summaries, guides, or inline documentation | Markdown/MDX artefact under `SuperClaude/Implementation/` |
| *Use `SuperClaude backup --restore`* | Restore workspace backups generated by the installer CLI | Snapshot written to `.claude/` |

> Legacy commands `/sc:save` and `/sc:load` are archived. `/sc:document` replaces
> the old `/sc:reflect` workflow for capturing follow-up notes. Use the
> the top-level `SuperClaude backup` command for snapshot/restore workflows
> until a new `/sc:` persistence interface is introduced.

## Flags Common to Most Commands

- `--think <1-3>`: Controls reasoning depth and consensus quorum selection.
- `--consensus`: Forces multi-model votes regardless of command defaults.
- `--fast-codex`: Routes implementation work through the lean Codex persona
  (requires live API keys and the `codex` CLI on your PATH).
- `--safe`: Disables risky modes such as fast-codex and enforces stricter
  guardrails.
- `--delegate <agent>`: Pin execution to a specific agent.
- `--loop`: Allow iterative agent hand-offs until success criteria are met.

See the individual command modules under `SuperClaude/Commands/` for extended
options and YAML front matter describing required context.
