# MCP Server Integrations (Stub)

SuperClaude bundles three MCP integrations (Sequential, Zen, Deepwiki) with
configuration stored under `SuperClaude/MCP`.

Refer to the core assets for the current connection details:

- [MCP integration module](../../SuperClaude/MCP/__init__.py)
- [Integration manifests](../../SuperClaude/MCP/integrations/)
- [Core tooling reference](../../SuperClaude/Core/TOOLS.md)

## Getting Started

- Run `SuperClaude install --components mcp` to provision the recommended set.
- Inspect `.claude.json` after installation to confirm endpoints.

This placeholder keeps the README link working while the full integration guide
is reconstructed.
