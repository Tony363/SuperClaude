unified registry. For the authoritative catalogue consult:

- [Agent registry YAML](../../SuperClaude/Core/agent_registry.yaml)

## Quick Navigation

- Use `/sc:agents` with the `--delegate` flag to trigger automatic selection.
- Review [Business Panel examples](../../SuperClaude/Core/BUSINESS_PANEL_EXAMPLES.md)
  for cross-agent workflows.
