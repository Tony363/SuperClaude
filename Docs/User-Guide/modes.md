# Behavioral Modes (Stub)

Modes steer how SuperClaude routes tasks and balances quality vs. speed. The
core documentation already describes each mode in depth:

- [Core profile](../../SuperClaude/Core/CLAUDE_CORE.md)
- [Extended capabilities](../../SuperClaude/Core/CLAUDE_EXTENDED.md)
- [Principles and heuristics](../../SuperClaude/Core/PRINCIPLES.md)

## Quick Reference

- Use `/sc:mode set <mode-name>` to switch personas.
- Combine modes with flags for fine-grained behaviour (see [Flags](flags.md)).

Additional walkthroughs, flow diagrams, and troubleshooting tips will land here
as the v6 documentation refresh continues.
