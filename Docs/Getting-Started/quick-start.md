# Quick Start (Stub)

This quick start mirrors the flow described in the README and the core bundle.

## TL;DR

1. Clone the repository or install via PyPI.
2. Run the smoke benchmarks:
   ```bash
   python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py --suite smoke
   ```
3. Explore the orchestrated commands with `/sc:brainstorm "<idea>"`.
