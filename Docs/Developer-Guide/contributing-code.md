# Contributing Code (Stub)

Active contribution guidance lives alongside the core rulebook:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) — canonical contribution process.
- [Operations manual](../../SuperClaude/Core/OPERATIONS.md) — execution
  priorities and guardrails.
- [Rules (critical + recommended)](../../SuperClaude/Core/RULES.md) — quality and
  safety expectations.

## Getting Started

1. Open a draft PR referencing the relevant spec.
2. Run `pytest -q` before submitting.
3. Capture deviations or new policies in
   [`SuperClaude/Core/PRINCIPLES.md`](../../SuperClaude/Core/PRINCIPLES.md).

This stub keeps the documented links live while the fully produced developer
handbook is recreated.
