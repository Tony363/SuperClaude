# Developer Guide Overview

Welcome to the engineering side of SuperClaude. This section will catalogue the
architecture, contribution workflow, and extension points. For now, rely on the
core documents:

- [Core profile](../../SuperClaude/Core/CLAUDE_CORE.md)
- [Extended profile](../../SuperClaude/Core/CLAUDE_EXTENDED.md)
- [Operations manual](../../SuperClaude/Core/OPERATIONS.md)

Linked subsections provide the fastest route to system design notes and
contribution processes.
