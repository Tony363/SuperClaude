# Quick Start Practices (Stub)

Performance and security tips for standing up SuperClaude rapidly:

- [Rules (critical)](../../SuperClaude/Core/RULES_CRITICAL.md) — hard safety
  constraints.
- [Rules (recommended)](../../SuperClaude/Core/RULES_RECOMMENDED.md) — quality
  accelerators.
- [Operations manual](../../SuperClaude/Core/OPERATIONS.md) — how to apply the
  rules during command execution.

## Fast Checklist

1. Run the smoke benchmarks before feature sessions.
2. Enable the `/sc:quality` workflow for production-facing tasks.
3. Capture deviations as ADRs referencing `SuperClaude/Core/PRINCIPLES.md`.

Future revisions will add scenario tables, command macros, and troubleshooting
FAQs.
