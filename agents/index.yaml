# SuperClaude Agent Registry
# Version: 6.0.0
#
# This file defines all available agent personas for Claude Code.
# Agents are selected based on task context matching against triggers and categories.

version: "6.0.0"
description: "SuperClaude meta-prompt framework - 130+ specialized agent personas"

# Agent Selection Guidelines (Semantic, not algorithmic)
#
# Since SuperClaude is a pure prompts/config framework (no Python runtime),
# agent selection is performed semantically by the LLM based on these priorities:
#
# 1. EXACT TRIGGER MATCH (Highest Priority)
#    - If user's request contains a trigger keyword, prefer that agent
#    - Example: "debug this error" → root-cause-analyst (has "debug", "error" triggers)
#
# 2. CATEGORY MATCH (High Priority)
#    - Match based on domain context
#    - Example: Working on React code → frontend-architect or react-specialist
#
# 3. CORE BEFORE EXTENDED
#    - Prefer core agents (16) over extended agents (114) for common tasks
#    - Extended agents are specialists for niche domains
#
# 4. FILE CONTEXT
#    - Consider file types being edited
#    - .py files → python-expert, .ts files → typescript-pro, etc.
#
# 5. FALLBACK
#    - When uncertain, use general-purpose agent
#    - Ask for clarification if multiple agents match equally
