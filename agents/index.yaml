# SuperClaude Agent Registry
# Version: 7.0.0 (Tiered Architecture)
#
# DEPRECATED: This file is now auto-generated and should not be manually edited.
# The source of truth is the YAML frontmatter in each agent's markdown file.
# Run `python scripts/validate_agents.py` to validate agent definitions.
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility with tools that expect it.
# For the canonical list of agents, scan the directories:
#   - agents/core/*.md (16 primary agents)
#   - agents/traits/*.md (10 composable modifiers)
#   - agents/extensions/*.md (7 domain specialists)

# Agent Selection Guidelines
#
# Selection is performed by reading frontmatter from agent files:
#   1. Parse triggers from frontmatter
#   2. Match task keywords against triggers
#   3. Apply tier priority (core > extension)
#   4. Combine with requested traits
selection:
  type: semantic
  priority_order:
    - trigger_match
    - tier_priority
    - category_match
  fallback: general-purpose
