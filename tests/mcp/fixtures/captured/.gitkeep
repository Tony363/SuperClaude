# This directory stores captured MCP interactions for fixture generation.
# Files here are generated by running tests with MCP_CAPTURE_FILE set.
#
# Usage:
#   MCP_CAPTURE_FILE=tests/mcp/fixtures/captured/pal_tools.jsonl \
#   MCP_LIVE_TESTING_ENABLED=1 \
#   pytest tests/mcp/test_contract_validation.py -m live
#
# The captured fixtures can then be used by FakeMCPServer.from_fixtures()
# for deterministic testing without live MCP access.
