### 8 Clarifications Requiring Stakeholder Input

1. What defines a "sale"? (Price drop %, flag, or promotion?)
2. Should notifications batch multiple products?
3. Minimum discount % to trigger notification?
4. Price history retention period?
5. Real-time sync requirements for mobile?
6. Product category exclusions?
7. Discontinued product handling?
8. SMS notification cost model?

### Non-Functional Targets

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Scale**: 100k concurrent users, 50M total favorites
